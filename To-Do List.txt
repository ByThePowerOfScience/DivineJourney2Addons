To-do list:

FIX QUANTUMFLUX MAGNET

**add tests to make sure that each addition/tweak/api works in-game**

Optimizations:
-Industrial Foregoing
	-IRedstoneControlledMachine$RedstoneControl$RedstoneOff.canRun() -> SidedTileEntity$update$1.invoke()
		-Problem: Seems like it calls World#getRedstonePower EVERY TICK.
		-Fix: Redstone only changes on block update; see if redstone power has changed only on block update and store that result until the next block update occurs.
	-0.21% | MaterialStoneWorkFactoryTile.performWork()
		-Problem: Lot of time spent on FurnaceRecipes.getSmeltingResult()
		-Fix: cache result since the input will NEVER change
-EnderIO
	-0.03% | SagMillMachineRecipe.getBonusType()
-Agricraft
	-0.23% | JsonPlant.getHarvestProducts() -> ReferencePipeline.forEach()
	-0.08% + 0.50% | GrowthRequirement.hasValidSoil() -> Optional.filter()
		* Problem: We're checking over a whole list every single time the crop is ticked for if it is on a valid soil block
		* Fix: The soil block can never change without a block update, so only recheck for valid soil on block update and save to a bool, then use that on tick.
-Extra Utilities
	-Mechanical User
		-Problem: TileUse.operate() taking 1.8% of total server time???  There's no way there are enough of them on the server that are constantly active to be doing this.
		-Fix?: If the mode requires an item (e.g. Activate Block with Item), check if there's an item first before firing?
			-TODO: Check in base with Mineralis cape to see if there's any mechanical users set to fire constantly
-Actually Additions:
	-TileEntityLaserRelay.getNetwork() - 1.46%, try and cache?
			-> LaserRelayConnectionHandler.getNetworkFor() -> ConcurrentHashMap$KeyIterator.next() | 0.85%
			<- TileEntityLaserRelayItem.saveDataOnChangeOrWorldStart() every tick
		-Also in TileEntityLaserRelayFluids.transmitFluid()
			* Why is it using ConcurrentHashMap$KeyIterator.next() instead of a hash lookup?
				* Answer: Because it needs to check the key for if it contains the position.
			* Should we cache this value? We'd need to find a way to ensure that it's accurate by rechecking it if it's dirty
				* Wait no it's ALREADY cached. But the fact that it's being called this often means that it's not good enough, since we aren't changing networks that often in the slightest.
		- 12.97% CLIENT: Also being called EVERY SINGLE **FRAME** on the client

-Redstone called every update tick (World.isBlockIndirectlyGettingPowered() might not be optimizable??)
	-IE: 
		-TileEntityMultiblockMetal.update() -> TileEntityMultiblockMetal.isRSDisabled()
		-TileEntityMetalBarrel.update()
		-TileEntitySampleDrill.update()
	-Astral: TileChalice.update()
	-Thaumcraft: TileThaumatorium.gettingPower()




Optimizations DONE:
-Plant interactor:
		-0.20% | BlockUtils.canBlockBeBroken()
			-Problem: called even when harvesting operation doesn't require it to be broken
			-Fix: change order of checks
-Agricraft
	-1.42% | Hydrator
			-TileEntityCrop.onGrowthTick(): [0.89% | TileEntityCrop.spread() -> 0.70% | GrowthRequirement.hasValidSoil()]
			-Fix: Check if there aren't any empty adjacent filled cropsticks FIRST
			-Fixed in MTileEntityCrop
-Aether
	-AbilityAccessories.onUpdate() creating new itemstacks every tick [could still be optimized further with direct substitution instead of a map] [MAbilityAccessories]
