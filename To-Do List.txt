To-do list:

FIX QUANTUMFLUX MAGNET

**add tests to make sure that each addition/tweak/api works in-game**

Optimizations:
-Industrial Foregoing
	-1.42% | Hydrator
		-Block.randomTick() -> Optional.get() -> BlockCrop$$Lambda$8493.885801297.accept() -> TileEntityCrop.onGrowthTick()
			-[0.89% | TileEntityCrop.spread() -> [0.70% | GrowthRequirement.hasValidSoil()]
				-Fix: Check if there aren't any empty adjacent filled cropsticks FIRST

	-IRedstoneControlledMachine$RedstoneControl$RedstoneOff.canRun() -> SidedTileEntity$update$1.invoke()
		-Problem: Seems like it calls World#getRedstonePower EVERY TICK.
		-Fix: Redstone only changes on block update; see if redstone power has changed only on block update and store that result until the next block update occurs.
	-0.21% | MaterialStoneWorkFactoryTile.performWork()
		-Problem: Lot of time spent on FurnaceRecipes.getSmeltingResult()
		-Fix: cache result since the input will NEVER change
-Agricraft
	-0.23% | JsonPlant.getHarvestProducts() -> ReferencePipeline.forEach()
-Extra Utilities
	-Mechanical User
		-Problem: TileUse.operate() taking 1.8% of total server time???  There's no way there are enough of them on the server that are constantly active to be doing this.
		-Fix?: If the mode requires an item (e.g. Activate Block with Item), check if there's an item first before firing?
		-TODO: Check in base with Mineralis cape to see if there's any mechanical users set to fire constantly
-Actually Additions:
	-TileEntityLaserRelay.getNetwork() - 1.46%, try and cache?
		-> LaserRelayConnectionHandler.getNetworkFor() -> ConcurrentHashMap$KeyIterator.next() | 0.85%
		<- TileEntityLaserRelayItem.saveDataOnChangeOrWorldStart() every tick

-Redstone called every update tick (World.isBlockIndirectlyGettingPowered() might not be optimizable??)
	-IE: 
		-TileEntityMultiblockMetal.update() -> TileEntityMultiblockMetal.isRSDisabled()
		-TileEntityMetalBarrel.update()
		-TileEntitySampleDrill.update()
	-Astral: TileChalice.update()
	-Thaumcraft: TileThaumatorium.gettingPower() 


Optimizations DONE:
-Plant interactor:
		-0.20% | BlockUtils.canBlockBeBroken()
			-Problem: called even when harvesting operation doesn't require it to be broken
			-Fix: change order of checks
-Aether
	-AbilityAccessories.onUpdate() creating new itemstacks every tick

-configanytime for thaumcraft jankconfig

-Mob Grinding Utils
 	-Fix: Ender inhibitor not working consistently

-Roots
	-Projectiles spell? need more info
	-Disable modifiers through `Modifiers.disableModifier("mod")` doesn't visually disable them
	-if an herb slot doesn't exist on a staff spell, shift-clicking it into the ui will still eat the herb
