Divine Journey 2 Addons contains some code from the mods it targets.  These sections are governed by the source projects' licenses.

Redistribution rights are granted to CurseForge for the purpose of distributing the mod on their platform.

You may not:
- Repackage code in this repository as part of another project, unless it is governed by another license;
- Copy code wholesale from this project;
- Rerelease this project in any way;
- Host the code under another repository as a way of redistributing a modified version of the source code.

You may:
- Use any APIs in this mod and reference its code in works that depend on it, obviously;
- Ask to be a maintainer if I’ve stopped working on it (0% chance I don't say yes);
- Make a fork of this repository to contribute to this project via Pull Request;
- Copy portions of individual methods solely for the act of @Overwriting the copied methods in a Mixin (because I know how finicky Mixin targeting can be sometimes and I’m all for soft-patching my code);
- Bytecode-manipulate the program at runtime, seriously you can go to town on it, it’s made to be Mixin’d;
- Make a mod mod mod for this mod mod that mods other mods.

Attempts to make a separate LTS version of this mod are not permitted under this license.  If you want long-term support for this project after it’s been abandoned, literally just ask me if you can be a maintainer and I will HAPPILY say yes.

I just don’t want 100 different versions of the same mod going around where people make fixes that aren’t duplicated for everyone.  I also don't like the habit people in the 1.12 community have had of running off with their own fork of a beloved mod just because they want to.

Also I just like having my name on it :P
