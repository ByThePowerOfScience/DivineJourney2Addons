Divine Journey 2 Addons contains some code from the mods it targets due to implementation restrictions.  Those sections are governed by the source projects' licenses.

Redistribution rights are granted to CurseForge for the purpose of distributing the mod on their platform.


## Restrictions and Provisions

#### You may:
- Use any APIs in this mod and reference its code in works that depend on it, obviously;
- Ask to be a maintainer if I’ve stopped working on it (99% chance I say yes);
- Make a fork of this repository, solely to contribute back to this repository via Pull Request;
- Copy portions of individual methods solely when @Overwriting the copied methods in a Mixin that targets this mod (because I know how finicky Mixin targeting can be sometimes and I’m all for soft-patching my code);
- Bytecode-manipulate this program at runtime (seriously you can go to town on it, it’s made to be Mixin’d);
- Make a mod mod mod for this mod mod that mods other mods.

#### You may not:
- Repackage code in this repository as part of another project, save for code that is governed by another license;
- Copy code wholesale from this project;
- Rerelease this project in any way;
- Host this code under another repository as a way of permanently hosting a modified version of the source code.

Attempts to make a separate LTS version of this mod are not permitted under this license.  If you want long-term support for this project after it’s been abandoned, literally just ask me if you can be a maintainer and I will HAPPILY say yes.


### Reasons for these restrictions:
1. This mod is made to fix things for _everyone_ in the 1.12 ecosystem, and forking the project splits the number of people who benefit from any changes. 
2. We have 3 different versions of UniversalTweaks that all conflict with one another and are missing some features from the others.  I don't want that to happen to this.
3. Honestly I just like keeping my name on it :P
