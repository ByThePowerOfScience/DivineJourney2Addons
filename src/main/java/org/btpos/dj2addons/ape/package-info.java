/**
 * <p>"Applied Programmatic Extension" package.
 * <p>Provides API extensions that Forge does not, and monkey-patches them onto various classes in mods and the base game forcing them to work together.
 * <p>A lot of the interfaces have long names, but in my eyes a more descriptive name is better than a concise name that's meaningless.</p>
 * <p></p>
 * <p></p>
 * <p>...and yes, it's a pun.</p>
